# PVOutput.Net

> A .NET wrapper library for the [PVOutput api](https://pvoutput.org/help.html#api-spec).

## Install

Nuget package will come when the implementation reaches a stable version.

## Usage

Not yet available, API documentation will come eventually.

## Building the source

As the whole solution is dotnet compatible, you can just run 

```posh
dotnet build
```

to build the solution or a single project. 

For unit testing, just run

```posh
dotnet test
```

## Contribute

As the code base is still changing a lot, PRs will probably be more practical, benefical and succesful after things have settled down a bit. But you can try.

## License

This project's structure and Json/Request handling have been seriously inspired (in part, copied even) by Henrik Fröhling's work on [TraktApiSharp](https://github.com/henrikfroehling/TraktApiSharp). While this project is licensed under the same license as TraktApiSharp, I'd still like to make this absolutely clear.
