# Domoticz.Net

> A .NET wrapper library for the [Domoticz JSON api](https://www.domoticz.com/wiki/Domoticz_API/JSON_URL's).

## Install

Not yet available. Expect Nuget.

## Usage

Not yet available, docs will come eventually.

## Contribute

As the code base is still changing a lot, PRs will probably be more practical, benefical and/or succesful after things have settled down a bit. But you can try.

## License

This project's structure and Json/Request handling have been heavily inspired (in part, copied) by Henrik Fröhling's work on [TraktApiSharp](https://github.com/henrikfroehling/TraktApiSharp). While this project is licensed under the same license as TraktApiSharp, I'd still like to stress this.
